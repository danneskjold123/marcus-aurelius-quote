  <p>
    This single-page application provides randomized quotes from Marcus Aurelius' <em>Meditations</em>.
    All quotes are taken from public domain translations and embedded directly in the page so the
    generator works entirely offline after saving <strong>index.html</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use the "New Quote" button or reload the page to receive a fresh passage of Stoic insight for reflection.
    The design is intentionally minimalist to keep attention on the wisdom.
